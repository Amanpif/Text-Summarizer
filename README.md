# Text Summarization Web App with Flask and PEGASUS

This is a simple web application built using Flask that utilizes the PEGASUS model from Hugging Face's Transformers library to summarize text input. The app allows users to input text, and it provides a concise summary based on the input using state-of-the-art natural language processing (NLP) techniques.

## Features

- **Text Summarization**: The core functionality of this app is to summarize user-provided text using the PEGASUS model.
- **Web Interface**: The app provides a clean, user-friendly interface where users can input text and view the generated summary.

## Prerequisites

Before running the project, make sure you have Python 3.x installed. You also need to install the following dependencies:

- Flask: A lightweight web framework for Python.
- Hugging Face's Transformers: A library for state-of-the-art NLP models.
- PyTorch: A deep learning library for training and running models.

## Installation

pip install -r requirements.txt
pip install flask torch transformers
